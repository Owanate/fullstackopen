## **Full Stack Web Development**

This repository contains the code for my assignments and projects for the Full Stack Web Development with React and Nodejs course from the University of Helsinki.Here, you will find all the necessary resources, code, and documentation to successfully complete the course and get the certificate.

### Course Overview
The course focuses on providing a comprehensive understanding of various technologies and concepts essential for full stack web development. The course covers the following technologies:

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces and web applications with reusable components.
- **Redux:** A state management library that works seamlessly with React to manage application state efficiently.
- **React Native:** A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using React.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **GraphQL:** A modern query language for APIs, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Node.js:** A powerful server-side JavaScript runtime that allows running JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **Express.js:** A flexible and minimalistic web application framework for Node.js, perfect for building APIs and server-side applications.

I will also learn the following concepts:
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Techniques and tools for automating code integration, testing, and deployment.
- **Containers:** Concepts related to containerization, likely involving Docker, for scalable and reproducible deployments.
- **Relational Databases:** An introduction to working with relational databases to persist data in web applications.

### Repository Structure
The repository will be organized in parts corresponding to the structure the course is organized.

### Acknowledgments
